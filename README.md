# ARVP Software Onboarding 2019

When someone is interested in joining a robotics club, they want to see immediate results and picture themselves doing cool things with a robot.

Before 2019 the the Autonomous Robotic Vehicle Project's (ARVP) onboarding focused on some programming basics using the Robot Operating System (ROS) to publish and subscribe to messages. It wasn't very visual. As a result, very few people held interest long enough to complete it.

As a software team co-lead, I decided to write a comprehensive document that would show prospective members how to issue commands to our simulator. They would write a mission for the robot in C++, and be able to watch it execute their commands.

Overall, it really helped engage people for longer.
